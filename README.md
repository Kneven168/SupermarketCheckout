# Supermarket Checkout App

## Description
This application emulates a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a basket of items, taking into account special promotional offers (e.g., "3 for the price of 2"). Provided that prices and promotions can change relatively frequently.

## Architecture

The application is built as a monolith but with a clear logical separation of modules internally which could be separate as independent microservices 

- **Product Module**: Responsible for CRUD operations on the product catalog.
- **Checkout Module**:  Responsible for all business logic related to the shopping process.

## Data Flow:

- **Products** are stored in PostgreSQL as the single source of truth. They are cached in Redis for faster access.
- **Baskets** are temporary and stored exclusively in Redis for maximum performance.
- **Orders** are permanent records of completed purchases and are saved to PostgreSQL.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Java 17** with Spring Boot 3.2.5 & WebFlux
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database for storing the product catalog and final orders
- **Spring Data R2DBC** for reactive database access 
- **Redis wish Spring Data Redis Reactive** for caching products and storing temporary customer baskets
- **Testing** JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers for integration testing
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI** for API documentation

### Frontend (generated with AI)
- **Angular 20** with standalone components
- **TypeScript 5.9** for type safety
- **Angular Signals** for reactive state management

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization
- **Gradle** for build automation

## Features

- **Basket Management**: Create, modify, delete, and checkout shopping baskets
- **Promotional Pricing**: Automatic calculation of special offers (e.g., "3 for 130" instead of 3Ã—50)
- **Display the price** displaying the current price of the basket after each addition and removal of a product
- **Checkout Process**: Complete order processing with order history in DB
